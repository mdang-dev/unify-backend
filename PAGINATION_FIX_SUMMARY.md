# Pagination Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The pagination was showing only 1 page regardless of the number of records because the **count query** in the repository was incorrectly counting the total number of records.

## Root Cause

The count query was using `GROUP BY p.id` which was causing it to count grouped records instead of the total number of posts. This made Spring Data think there was only 1 page of results.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect Count Query):

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM Posts p
LEFT JOIN comments c ON p.id = c.post_id
WHERE (...)
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING (...)
```

### After (Corrected Count Query):

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) FROM Posts p
WHERE (...)
AND (:commentCount IS NULL OR
    CASE
        WHEN :commentCountOperator = '>' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE post_id = p.id) > :commentCount
        WHEN :commentCountOperator = '<' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE post_id = p.id) < :commentCount
        WHEN :commentCountOperator = '=' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE post_id = p.id) = :commentCount
        WHEN :commentCountOperator = '>=' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE post_id = p.id) >= :commentCount
        WHEN :commentCountOperator = '<=' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE post_id = p.id) <= :commentCount
        ELSE TRUE
    END)
```

## Key Changes

1. **Removed `GROUP BY p.id`**: This was causing the count to be incorrect
2. **Removed `LEFT JOIN comments`**: Not needed for counting posts
3. **Moved comment count logic to subqueries**: More efficient and accurate
4. **Changed `HAVING` to `AND`**: Since we're no longer using GROUP BY

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ **Multiple pages**: Should show correct number of pages based on total records
- ✅ **Correct `totalElements`**: Should show actual total number of matching posts
- ✅ **Correct `totalPages`**: Should be calculated as `totalElements / pageSize`
- ✅ **Proper pagination**: Different results on different pages

## Test Cases

1. **Basic pagination**: `GET /posts/filter?page=0&size=5`
2. **Second page**: `GET /posts/filter?page=1&size=5`
3. **With filters**: `GET /posts/filter?status=1&page=0&size=10`

## Verification

Check that the response includes:

- `totalElements`: Should be > 0 and consistent across pages
- `totalPages`: Should be > 1 if you have more records than pageSize
- `last`: Should be `false` on first pages, `true` on last page
- `first`: Should be `true` on first page, `false` on other pages

## Debugging

If pagination still shows only 1 page:

1. **Check database**: Ensure you have enough records to create multiple pages
2. **Check SQL logs**: Verify the count query is running correctly
3. **Check response**: Verify `totalElements` and `totalPages` values
4. **Test with different pageSize**: Try `size=1` to force multiple pages
