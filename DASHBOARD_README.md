# Dashboard Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Dashboard feature provides comprehensive statistics for the Unify platform, including user metrics, post analytics, and report management data.

## Features Implemented

### Dashboard Statistics API

- **Endpoint**: `GET /dashboard/stats`
- **Access**: Admin only (requires ADMIN role)
- **Response**: JSON object with platform statistics

### Data Provided

#### Current Statistics

- `totalUsers`: Total number of registered users (excluding admins)
- `totalPosts`: Total number of posts (excluding deleted/sensitive content)
- `totalPendingReports`: Number of reports with pending status (status = 1)
- `activeUsers`: Number of users who posted in the last 30 days
- `newReportsToday`: Number of new reports submitted today

#### Growth Metrics (vs Last Month)

- `userGrowthPercent`: New users this month compared to total users last month [(new users this month)/(total users last month)]\*100
- `postGrowthPercent`: New posts this month compared to total posts last month [(new posts this month)/(total posts last month)]\*100
- `activeUserGrowthPercent`: New active users this month compared to total active users last month [(new active users this month)/(total active users last month)]\*100

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **DashboardStatsDto** (`src/main/java/com/unify/app/dashboard/domain/models/DashboardStatsDto.java`)

   - Data transfer object for dashboard statistics
   - Uses Lombok annotations for clean code

2. **DashboardRepository** (`src/main/java/com/unify/app/dashboard/domain/DashboardRepository.java`)

   - Repository interface with JPA queries
   - Handles data aggregation and filtering

3. **DashboardService** (`src/main/java/com/unify/app/dashboard/domain/DashboardService.java`)

   - Business logic for calculating statistics
   - Growth percentage calculations
   - Date range management

4. **DashboardController** (`src/main/java/com/unify/app/dashboard/web/DashboardController.java`)

   - REST API endpoint
   - Admin-only access control
   - Returns JSON response

5. **DashboardServiceTest** (`src/test/java/com/unify/app/dashboard/DashboardServiceTest.java`)
   - Unit tests for service functionality
   - Mock-based testing

### Key Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only users with ADMIN role can access dashboard data
- **Growth Calculations**: Uses formula [(new entities this month)/(total entities last month)]\*100
- **Active User Definition**: Users who posted in the last 30 days
- **Report Status Filtering**: Only counts pending reports (status = 1)
- **Date-based Filtering**: Uses proper date/time functions for accurate calculations
- **Accurate Period Comparison**: Last month data is correctly bounded between last month start and current month start

### Database Queries

- Uses JPA/Hibernate for database operations
- Optimized queries with proper joins and filtering
- Handles null values and edge cases

## Usage Example

```bash
# Get dashboard statistics (requires admin authentication)
GET /dashboard/stats

# Response example:
{
  "totalUsers": 12547,
  "totalPosts": 38291,
  "totalPendingReports": 23,
  "activeUsers": 8923,
  "userGrowthPercent": 12.5,
  "postGrowthPercent": 8.2,
  "activeUserGrowthPercent": 15.3,
  "newReportsToday": 5
}
```

## Security

- Endpoint protected with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`
- Requires valid JWT token with ADMIN role
- Follows existing security patterns in the application

## Future Enhancements

- Add more granular time periods (weekly, daily)
- Include additional metrics (engagement rates, content types)
- Add caching for performance optimization
- Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
